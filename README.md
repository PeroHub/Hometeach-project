>## Objective
Education in Nigeria and Africa at large is poor compared to the rest of the world. The lack of access to quality infrastructure, lecturers, materials and other inadequacies that follow the traditional approach of pure classroom learning has caused a huge barrier in education.
The objective of Hometech is to bridge these inadequacies by providing a platform for students and lecturers to connect with each other.


#
>## Project Overview
Hometech is an application that will help teachers to render their services effectively
and also allows student to sign up and choose select courses from the list of curated top
performing best reviewed best instructors.

The platform will allow the student/parent to place a booking for their preferred selected 
tutor-with the help of a filter search result and either choose to arrange class online or
offline and get to make payment once they are satisfy.

The site will also allow teacher to grade student and send proper feedback where necessary.

#
> ## Target Audience
The application is targeted at people in the following cadres:
- Africans
- Rural and urban areas
- All kinds of learners regardless of age and educational status
- English-speaking users (for the MVP)

> ## How to contribute and making PR

The Zuriteam Team 80 frontend repository was forked and cloned to create a copy on my local machine. 

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/zuri-training/HomeTeach-fe-pjt-80
```
Set the clone repo as my "upstream" and the forked repo as the "origin".

```bash
# git remote add https://github.com/zuri-training/HomeTeach-fe-pjt-80
```

Change directory into clone project
```bash
 # cd HomeTeach-fe-pjt-80
```

Open with Vscode through terminal or directly from vscode
```bash
  # code .
```

After making changes on vscode, check status
```bash
  # git status
```

Add the changes made
```bash
 # git commit add .
```

Commit the changes made
```bash
  # git commit -m "your comment here"
```

Create a branch
```bash
  # git checkout -b your branch name goes there (i.e git checkout -b signup)
```

Then push to the newly create branch
```bash
  # git push origin the branch name you just created (git push origin signup)
```

Voila :smile: :laughing: :relaxed: you are good to go!

Copy the url prompted on the terminal/cmd and paste on your browser and proceed making a pull request :bowtie:
